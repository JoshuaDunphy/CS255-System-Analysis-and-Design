Project Summary

DriverPass is a startup founded by Liam, aimed at improving DMV test pass rates by offering students online practice exams and on-the-road driving lessons. The client wanted a web-based system that allows:





Students to register, take practice tests, track progress, and schedule in-person training.



Instructors to manage sessions and submit feedback.



Administrators to upload content, monitor activity, and generate reports.



Secure payment processing for course fees.

This project involved creating a Business Requirements Document (Project One) and a System Design Document (Project Two), including UML diagrams (Use Case, Activity, Sequence, Class) to model the system’s functionality and structure.



What I Did Particularly Well

I believe I excelled in translating the client’s vision into clear, structured UML diagrams. The Use Case Diagram effectively captured all user roles and key interactions, while the Activity Diagram for "Take Practice Exam" provided a logical, step-by-step flow that directly supports the goal of improving student preparation. My Class Diagram was well-organized with appropriate relationships (e.g., Student to Schedule, Course to Student via enrollment), showing a solid understanding of object-oriented design.



One Area I’d Revise

If I could revise one part, I would enhance the Sequence Diagram by including error handling paths (e.g., invalid login, payment failure). While the current version shows the happy path clearly, adding alternative flows would make it more comprehensive and realistic, better preparing developers for edge cases.



Interpreting User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by closely analyzing the DriverPass Interview Transcript and Business Requirements Document. For example:





Liam emphasized online practice exams with feedback → led to detailed activity and sequence diagrams.



Ian highlighted cloud backup and security → influenced technical requirements and security features.



The need for progress tracking → resulted in a progressScore attribute in the Student class.

Considering user needs is critical because a system that doesn’t solve real problems—even if technically sound—will fail. By prioritizing usability, accessibility, and security, the design ensures students, instructors, and admins can achieve their goals efficiently and safely.



My Approach to Software Design

I approach design with a user-centered, iterative process:





Listen & Clarify – Conduct thorough requirement gathering (interviews, documents).



Model Behavior – Use UML diagrams to visualize use cases, flows, interactions, and data structure.



Validate – Cross-check designs against client goals and real-world constraints (budget, timeline).



Simplify & Scale – Focus on core features first, design modularly for future growth.

In the future, I’ll continue using Lucidchart for diagrams, GitHub for version control, and agile principles to refine designs based on feedback.
